                <p>As development practitioners, we recognise that data is critical in conceiving, implementing, and monitoring community-based interventions. Grassroots evidence is useful to understand the impact (or lack thereof) of interventions and make a case for policy changes. We primarily rely on the expertise and objectivity of researchers, academics, and subject-matter experts to generate sound data, present evidence-based learnings, and guide decision-making, even within highly localised contexts.</p>

                <p>US democracy is threatened this election cycle. After the 2020 election, which culminated in former President Donald Trump rejecting his loss and his followers rioting in Washington, DC, election violence is expected this time. Todays disinformation is particularly dangerous for election security. We need to reform our electoral process for long-term stability</p>

                <h3>News 5</h3>
                <p>India spearheaded the United Nations’ resolution to designate 2023 as the International Year of Millets. This was in honour of the small-seeded grasses that have been cultivated and consumed in the country for centuries. These hardy, nutrition-dense grains are water-efficient, do not require chemical inputs, and can weather extreme heat and drought, making them an essential tool in ensuring food and nutrition security in a warming world. The reasons to scale millets are myriad and evident. But despite strong policy signals and good intent, significant challenges stand in the way.</p>
